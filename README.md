# Fraudulent Job Postings
Restricted to only install scikit-learn, gensim, and pandas

The full instructions to this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/victorbpeterson/Fraudulent-Job-Postings/blob/main/Instructions.md)

## Goal
Use the data provided to create a classifier so that when given a job posting, it can predict whether it is fake or real.
Submissions were ranked by their F1 score and graded accordingly (higher F1 = higher grade). All submissions needed a total runtime no more than 30 minutes. 

## Outcome
Spent many hours researching and testing different models, preprocessing methods, and tuning methods.
My [finished product](https://github.com/victorbpeterson/Fraudulent-Job-Postings/blob/main/Project/project.py) outperformed all but one of my peers.

F1: .81

Total Runtime: ~ 18 seconds
